### About
This is my submission for the coding challenge
I figured, that libraries for the frontend were frowned upon given the nature of the challenge, so although almost always I use libraries (or create my own) for cleaner code, this is a little messy due to that.

Due time constraints (Midterm Season), several things were ommited:

- Animations (Animations through react without libraries is clunky and weird, and takes a long time)
- The bonus API (although easily extendable due to nature)
- Redux (usually do this, but because this was a prototype, decided not to, due to limited data interaction)
- Tests 

If this is not sufficent to look at my skills, please lmk and I can show/do more. 

### Tests

No tests were written for this implementation 

### Running

docker-compose build
docker-compose up 
```
If you dont have docker,
